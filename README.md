Our system implements a dual-module tracking system that can be applied to optical wireless communication technology.

In the "Final" folder, two directories exist, one for the stationary module and one for the mobile module. All code
needed for full functionality of the system is included in these two folders. Copies of functional code was periodically
uploaded throughout the semester and can be found in the "3.28", "3.23", and "Old" folders (representing March 28, March 23,
and everything before).
