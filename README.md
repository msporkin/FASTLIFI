Our system implements a dual-module tracking system that can be applied to optical wireless communication technology.

In the "Final" folder, two directories exist, one for the stationary module and one for the mobile module. All code
needed for full functionality of the system is included in these two folders. Copies of functional code was periodically
uploaded throughout the semester and can be found in the "3.28", "3.23", and "Dated" folders (representing March 28, March 23,
and everything before).

In the "Stationary" directory, running the "Stationary Search" script will begin the search on the stationary module.
In the "Mobile" directory, running the "Mobile Search" script will begin the search on the mobile module. All other library
scripts (CameraLibrary, ADCandTestLibrary, MotorLibrary, MobileMotorLibrary) should be downloaded as well and saved in the same
folder as the respective search script. Each library contains functions that are called in the search script and are necessary
for the successful operation of the code.

Beginning the "Stationary Search" script asks for input to name the test file. Typing "esc" into the command line at any time
will end the program on the stationary module. Everything else will continue autonomously and uninterrupted until "esc" is input.
